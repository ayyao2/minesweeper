# minesweeper
Minesweeper game created using Processing/Java.
The initial square indicates one safe square without mines in its surrounding 8 squares to start off.
Right-click is a flagging mechanism that turns the square red and prevents it from being clicked until it is unflagged with another right click.
The game restarts when a mine is hit.
